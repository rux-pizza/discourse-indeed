## History

The idea behind this plugin started as an inside joke in our own Discourse boards. One day the admin decided to lift the minimum post length restriction. Aimed towards allowing chat-like short messages such as "LOL" "WTF", it quickly became the norm to simply "empty reply". It became apparent that "empty replying" was the ideal choice to deal with posts that did not leave you indifferent but that were not good enough to merit a "like" or worth the effort or writing a commentary.

We took it to next level and turned it into a plugin that packages the whole thing into a single button. On a board with the default settings, it will save you from typing boilerplate HTML code that renders nothing yet be well above the minimum post length limit. Be warned, this plugin is intended to make obnoxiousness within anyone's reach at a click of a button.

As a bonus, the famous quote reply button also comes with its twin brother indeed reply. It will save you time when you wish to point out spelling or grammar mistakes from your Discourse fellows. Cookie points when leaves the OP a bitter taste."
